A quick JavaScript game I made

GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT.....
    - If the player rolls a 1 for ONE of the dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
    - If a player rolls two 6s, all his GLOBAL score and ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- By default, the goal of the game is to reach 100, but players have the ability to change the score
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
